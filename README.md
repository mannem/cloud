Performance studies of different Distributed File Systems

Project Description:
 
♦ Explore different file systems
§ HDFS and HBASE http://hadoop.apache.org/
 HDFS is the file system and HBASE is the big table
§ Swift: http://swift.openstack.org/
§ Ceph: http://ceph.com/
§ Lustre: http://www.lustre.org/
♦ Identify a feature vector (what features should be considered if a user needs to select a file system to use)
§ Access latency, access throughput, directory service latency, etc.
§ Consistency model and solutions, availability solutions, etc.
§ Other special features
♦ Use IOzone as a benchmark to measure the performance features of the file systems
§ http://www.iozone.org/
 
Ø Project steps
♦ Investigate and report the major characteristics of different distributed file systems
♦ Identify and report the feature vector of distributed file systems
♦ Implementation
§ Set up 4 file systems on a cluster
§ Modify IOzone so that
